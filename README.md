# List input event devices - evlist

API Documentation

List input event devices under `/dev/input/eventX` and format device information and capabilities.

## Usage

List all devices and format as a table:

```sh
evlist
```

Or as a CSV:

```sh
evlist --format csv
```

The functionality of this is similar to [`libinput list-devices`][list-devices], however it can also filter on a
specific value. Filter devices where the device name equals `device_name`:

```sh
evlist --filter name=device_name
```

This also supports filtering based on regex:

```sh
evlist --filter name=device* --use-regex
```

> [!NOTE]
> Viewing and filtering capabilities requires elevated privileges.

## Build

This project uses a [just] to manage development, [conan] as the package manager and [cmake] as the build tool.
To build the project, run:

```sh
just build
```

This requires at least [gcc-14] or [clang-19] because the project uses newer C++23 features.

## Development

Tests can be run using:

```sh
just test
```

This project uses [pre-commit] and [clang-tidy] should to lint code. To format and lint the code run:

```sh
just check
```

## Library usage

This project can also be built and used as a library. Functionality is available from `#include <evlist/evlist.h>`,
including functions to iterate and parse `/dev/input`. View the API docs [here][api-docs].

The library can be built without the binary using:

```sh
just build_lib
```

If using this project as a submodule and cmake, it can be included by using `add_subdirectory` and linking against the
`libevlist` target:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(evlist)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE libevlist)
```

Code documentation can be generated by running:

```sh
just doc
```
