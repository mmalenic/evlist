# API reference for evlist

The documentation here is an API reference for using evlist as a library. It contains descriptions of classes and
functions that are part of evlist, under the `evlist` namespace. Functionality is available from
`#include <evlist/evlist.h>`, including functions to iterate and parse `/dev/input`.
